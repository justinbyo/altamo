- [ ] make the nav element sticky
- [ ] make top-level menus collapsable ie. "Appetizers" and "Pizza"
- [ ] remove cash option
- [x] edit state in place for order page and checkout page
- [ ] continue to refine pages depending on state
- [x] figure out how to handle a mock order -- i.e. each time the user hits "update order" from checkout screen, the summary page needs to update with new total and items etc.
- [ ] onboarding flow needs to include seat confirmation and instructions
- [ ] TBD "add payment now" option to submit payment to start tab and add items later
- [ ] add timer to edit order functionality
- [ ] after timer is done, show the user a screen that says "order with the pen and pad please"
- [ ] remove added items from cart before submitting
- [ ] figure out if we need to treat each new edit session as a distinct new order submission -- ie. after the user sumibt changes from edit 1, is the cart completely empty blank slate for edit 2
